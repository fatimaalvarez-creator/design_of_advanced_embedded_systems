# 🧠 Design of Advanced Embedded Systems

This repository contains projects, labs, and resources developed during the **Design of Advanced Embedded Systems** course. The objective of this subject is to design, implement, and test complex single-chip embedded systems by integrating processing modules, control systems, communication protocols, and peripherals.
